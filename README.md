# document_analysis_project
This project is a local AI-powered system for automated document analysis. It extracts text from scanned or digital documents, classifies them into categories (e.g., invoices, contracts), detects anomalies (e.g., missing signatures, unusual amounts), and provides insights through a visual dashboardâ€”all without relying on large language models.
